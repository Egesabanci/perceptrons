# Perceptron Project
This repository contains, very simple `single-layer perceptron` implementation in Rust
programming language. :mechanical_arm:

### What is `Perceptron`?
In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.
